    n a place where change often moves slowly, a converging of micro and macro factors have recently triggered a positive inflection point for Japanese equities.

With the Topix reaching highs not seen since Sega were exporting the mega drive, below we cover some of the key structural drivers behind the recent resurgence in Japanese equities and why we think they could remain in the early stages of a multi-year structural bull market.

Corporate capital reforms paying dividends
------------------------------------------

The fundamental shift towards better corporate governance practices in Japan has gathered momentum in recent years. Initiated by the Abe government, significant legislative reforms – which included revisions to Japan's Stewardship Code and the introduction of Japan's Corporate Governance Code (CGC) – articulated for the first time a clear framework for shareholder orientated corporate governance in Japan. The hard evidence of these positive changes to capital management have been increasingly flowing through to shareholder returns.

Dividend growth in Japan has experienced a remarkable year-on-year increase of close to 10% over the past decade, while payout ratios have remained at lower levels than those of the US and Europe, suggesting significant scope for further growth. Meanwhile, 2023 is shaping up to be a record year for company share buybacks with ${'$'}50bn already announced through May (vs ${'$'}100bn in 2022).1

All this at a time when earnings growth is showing resilience, indicating that Japanese companies look set to continue unlocking capital they have accumulated over decades (just under 50% of Japan's companies are still net cash vs 10-15% in the US and Europe).2

Foreign investors return
------------------------

One of the key objectives of Japan's corporate governance reforms was to reshape the Japanese equities market to one that would better resemble other developed markets in terms of prioritising shareholders and delivering shareholder value – ostensibly with an aim of making Japanese equities more attractive to foreign investors. This appears to be working, with a fresh wave of foreign investors purchasing a net ${'$'}15.6 billion worth of Japanese shares in April, the highest monthly level since 2017.3

Among them, Warren Buffet, who recently announced that Berkshire Hathaway now owns more stocks in Japan than in any other country outside of the US – having increased its investments in each of Japan's five largest trading companies from 5% to 7.4% and stating their plans to hold these investments for the next 10 to 20 years.4

Attractive relative valuations
------------------------------

On a pure valuation basis, Japanese equities remain one of the cheapest amongst developed market – particularly compared to the US S&P500. Critically, around half of Japanese companies are trading at discount to their book value,5 with the overall price-to-book ratio of the Topix at 1.37 vs. 4.19 for the S&P 500.

Macroeconomic environment: Supportive BoJ and weaker Yen
--------------------------------------------------------

Lastly, the BoJ remains highly accommodative, both in absolute terms and relative to other central banks. And though inflation is beginning to emerge, it still remains at levels lower than other developed markets. While this remains the case, it is broadly expected that the BoJ will maintain its policy stance to ensure inflation becomes entrenched around its 2% target. This is likely to continue to be supportive for risk assets, but also has the potential to sustain a weaker Yen (which is already weak based on FX fundamentals i.e. purchasing power parity) – providing earnings translation benefits for large Japanese multinationals and exporters, which are now ultra-competitive.

Emerging geopolitical considerations could provide additional tailwinds for Japanese manufactures. As a democratic and politically stable western ally, "Japan Inc", which has a long legacy of manufacturing leadership, has the potential to benefit from the growing need to fortify global supply and prioritise security and resilience over cost and efficiency.

Such "Friend shoring" will see Japan being a lynchpin for Asian-based supply chains, especially in the area of semiconductors. Seven of the world's largest semiconductor makers, including TSMC, Samsung and Intel, are planning to increase manufacturing capacity and strategic partnerships in Japan to take advantage of the highly skilled advanced manufacturing workforce and government incentives.

In addition, the global trend towards onshoring will drive demand for industrial and factory automation technology, where Japan is a global leader.

[HJPN Japan ETF – Currency Hedged](security://HJPN.AU)

HJPN aims to track the performance of an index (before fees and expenses) that provides diversified exposure to the largest globally competitive Japanese companies, hedged into Australian dollars.

A lower Yen tends to boost corporate earnings in Japan's export-oriented economy. However, if you are an offshore investor holding Japanese equities that are not currency hedged, any currency tailwind for Japanese corporate profitability could be partially or fully eroded by devaluation of Japanese equities in AUD terms.

In addition, currency hedging currently provides a 4.59% p.a. carry (as at 26 June 2023) vs. an equivalent unhedged exposure, due to the interest rate differential between Japan and Australia.

    Social media, digital advertising, and e-commerce were three huge trends for tech investors that defined the last decade. The impressive growth in these sectors helped propel Meta (formerly Facebook), Alphabet (formerly Google), and Amazon to among the largest companies in the world.

![trends-in-tech.jpg](https://powerful-oasis-c2085bc978.media.strapiapp.com/trends_in_tech_f759b1f5ca.jpg)

But a new order is emerging, and while many of the players remain the same, the game has changed.

Let's explore three important trends for tech investors to watch in the decade ahead.


## Artificial intelligence

Artificial intelligence (AI) has received a lot of attention this year, and for good reason. While the release of ChatGPT initially triggered the hype, real-life business applications are driving growth.

For evidence of this, one needs only look at Nvidia's stunning 843% year-on-year increase in profits in Q2 was largely driven by increased demand coming from data centres. Management points to Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, Meta, Microsoft Azure, and Oracle Cloud as drivers of demand. Revenue from data centres grew by 171% year-on-year [1].

Microsoft is beginning to roll out Copilot to enterprise users of Office. Copilot is said to cost US${'$'}30 per user per month – almost doubling the cost of a Microsoft 365 subscription. Copilot is an AI-powered personal assistant that can assist users with everything from organising their Outlook inbox to improving their Excel formulas. And it's not just Microsoft, Google, Zoom, and Salesforce have all begun rolling out AI-powered features in recent months [2].

**How to gain exposure**

[RBTZ Global Robotics and Artificial Intelligence ETF](security://RBTZ.AU) invests in companies involved in Industrial Robotics and Automation, Non-Industrial Robots, Artificial Intelligence and Unmanned Vehicles and Drones. In one trade, investors can get diversified, cost-effective exposure to the world's leading robotics and AI companies, a sector that is heavily under-represented on the ASX.

## Cybersecurity

Cybercrime has evolved from the days of unsophisticated spam emails riddled with spelling errors.

Today, cybercriminals are capable of generating realistic voices capable of fooling parents into thinking they're speaking to their own children. Modern cybercrime is both highly sophisticated and highly lucrative. In 2023, the global cost of cybercrime is expected to hit US${'$'}8 trillion [3].

The scope of the issue extends well beyond scamming private individuals. A ransomware group called Clop has reportedly compromised more than 730 organisations to date [4], extorting an estimated US${'$'}75-${'$'}100 million from victims [5]. And the number of significant cyber incidents has been growing.

Wherever crime proliferates, security is sure to follow. Global cybersecurity revenues grew from US${'$'}83 billion in 2016, to US${'$'}147 billion in 2022. This year the industry is expected to hit US${'$'}162 billion in revenues, and this number is projected to grow to US${'$'}256 billion by 2028 [6].

**How to gain exposure**

[HACK Global Cybersecurity ETF](security://HACK.AU) invests in leading companies in the global cybersecurity sector. The Fund's portfolio includes global cybersecurity giants, as well as emerging players, from a range of global locations.

## Climate change technology

If the world is to meet its climate goals, significant technological development will be needed across the vast range of industries. From energy generation and storage, to mobility, food and agriculture, investment is expected to drive growth.

Venture capital investors have clearly already noted this, with a 24x increase in investment for climate tech startups seen over the last decade [7].

It's not just startups though. Climate and sustainability technology is big business. Climate tech focused companies such as Ecolab, Vestas Wind Systems, and Kingspan are already valued in the 10s or even 100s of billions of dollars.

According to BloombergNEF, global investment in the energy transition topped US${'$'}1 trillion in 2022 [8]. But this is really just the beginning. The International Renewable Energy Agency suggests that US${'$'}5 trillion per year, for a cumulative US${'$'}150 trillion of investment will be required by 2050 for the world to achieve the 1.5°C pathway [9].
